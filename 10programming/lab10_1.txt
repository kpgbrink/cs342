Exercise 10.1

a. Does Oracle handle the transaction life-cycle (see Figure 20.4) 
   with respect to starting and stopping SQL*Plus sessions?
   
   TLDR: Yes.
   When I deleted or added something to the movie table in one session
   and then checked to see if it changed in another session the database was not changed.
   But when I closed the session where I added or deleted a row the other session
   saw the changes. So oracle does handle transaction life-cycle with respect to starting
   and stopping SQL*Plus sessions.
   
   
b. Can we implement any of the ACID properties using
   START-TRANSACTION/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/COMMIT?
   
   No because you need locking. Without locking you can have problems like lost update.
