Vision. 
I want to make a database system for a school scheduler. It would include logging in and making your own schedule. Basically a customizable 
schedule that is looks like slatepermutate but you can make a page that links you to important things for school. You would be able to choose
a schedule, add links to the classes. Add links to important things for school like, moodle, portal, and online textbooks. 
        
The stakeholders would be Calvin Students because they could use it to make it easier to keep on schedule and find the websites for 
their classes online. I have already made something similar to this but without a database and logins.
