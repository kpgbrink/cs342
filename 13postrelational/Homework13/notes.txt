a. What type of noSQL database system is Oracle’s NoSQL product, KVLite?

    key-value. It's in the name.

b. The Internet Movie DataBase (imdb.com) is currently implemented in mySQL. If you were required to port it to a noSQL system, which of the noSQL system types would you suggest? Explain your answer.

    MongoDB because I have the most experience with it and it is popular. It is also free and open-source. It has a nice document model and I think it would be good
    for a movie database.

c. Could you (efficiently) reuse the same key-value structure for exercise 13.1.d (above) and its “opposite”, i.e., get the movies in which a given actor is cast? Why or why not?

    No because you would have to switch which is the key and the value.

d. NoSQL databases are often referred to as schema-less or schema-free. Explain what this means using examples from your homework solution.

    Schemaless database lets you store items in collections with different sets of properties.
    It allows new features without restructuring the database which is what these queries are doing.
