Exercise 2.2
The original IMDB Movie table included fields for both score and votes. 
Can you add a constraint (using the mechanisms we’ve studied) the requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes? 
If so, explain what constraint you’d specify; if not, include an explanation of why it’s not possible.
-- Yes you can. CONSTRAINT chk_score_makes_sense CHECK( (score NOT-NULL AND votes > 1000) OR score IS NULL ) would check it. This makes sure that if the score is not null then the voes have to
-- be over 1000. If the score is null then it does not check the votes.

Database systems, including Oracle, allow DBAs to create separate constraints that are set on given tables, which allows DBAs to turn constraints off and on during database operations, e.g.:

ALTER TABLE tableName
    ADD CONSTRAINT constraintName
    someConstraint;
Can you imagine when, if ever, you might want to separate a constraint from the table definition it modifies? If so, describe the circumstances; if not, explain why not.
-- I can imagine it. If you wanted to start putting in data with a new constraint then you would use this. Although that seems ugly and I would rather avoid doing it.
