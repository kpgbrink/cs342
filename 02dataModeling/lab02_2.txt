Exercise 2.2
The original IMDB Movie table included fields for both score and votes. 
Can you add a constraint (using the mechanisms we’ve studied) the requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes? 
If so, explain what constraint you’d specify; if not, include an explanation of why it’s not possible.
-- Yes you can. CONSTRAINT chk_score_makes_sense CHECK( score NOT-NULL AND votes > 1000 )

Database systems, including Oracle, allow DBAs to create separate constraints that are set on given tables, which allows DBAs to turn constraints off and on during database operations, e.g.:

ALTER TABLE tableName
    ADD CONSTRAINT constraintName
    someConstraint;
Can you imagine when, if ever, you might want to separate a constraint from the table definition it modifies? If so, describe the circumstances; if not, explain why not.
