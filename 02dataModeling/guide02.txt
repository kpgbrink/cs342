1. Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1–5.2)
   1. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
Ted Codd. IBM. 1970.
   2. Explain the following terms:
   1. Relation : a table of attributes and values
   2. Attribute : Column header
   3. Domain : possible values in column
   4. N-tuple : ordered list of n values. record/tuple.
   5. NULL value : values which are used to represent the values of attributes that may be unknown or may not apply to a tuple. 
   6. primary, foreign, candidate and super keys : primary- key for relation it is in. only on key. candidate- if more than one key super keys- similar to candidate but the minimum amount of keys that uniquely identify each row.
   7. referenced and referencing records : referenced- record that is has id pointing to it from another one. Referencing- having id pointing to other record.
   1. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.
Tuples in a relation: Not ordered. Elements in a set do not have order among them and there is no reason to have them ordered.
Attribute Values in a tuple: Ordered. In order to match values with an attribute they are ordered.
   2. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?
No, because there is only a certain amount of allocated space for each value.
      1. Chapter 6 (focus primarily on Sections 6.1–6.2 & 6.4) — Make sure that you know how to:
      1. Create tables with specified constraints, including primary/foreign key, not-null, domain and value-check constraints.
CREATE TABLE COMPANY.EMPLOYEE
(
Employee_id int PRIMARY_KEY,
Boss_id int FOREIGN_KEY,
Kris int CHECK (Kris > 4)
)
      2. Use the DML commands: INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES (5, 3, 4);
DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 8;
UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET PHONE = 61645423454 WHERE ID = 3;
      3. Distinguish the ON DELETE actions: SET NULL; CASCADE.
SET NULL: Value of the affected referencing attributes is changed to NULL.
CASCADE: Delete all referencing tuples.
